*Description* :

The Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor is an interactive web application designed to enable multiple users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents simultaneously from different locations. Leveraging modern web technologies, this project provides a seamless, responsive, and dynamic user experience with real-time synchronization of content, ensuring that all collaborators see updates instantaneously.

Frontend: The user interface is built using advanced JavaScript frameworks such as React.js or Vue.js, which offer component-based architecture and efficient state management. This enables a responsive and dynamic UI, allowing users to easily navigate documents, format text, and observe live updates without page reloads.

Backend: The backend is developed using Node.js with Express, or Python frameworks such as Django or Flask, which handle API requests, user authentication, and real-time communication. The server manages document sessions, synchronizes changes from multiple users, and ensures data consistency using web sockets (e.g., Socket.IO) or similar real-time communication protocols.
